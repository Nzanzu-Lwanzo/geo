# GEO

## How do I use Geo ?

Simple. Just pull the Docker image `lwanzo/geo:latest` and do whatever you want with it. All the data is self contained.
Or, you can use our API [right here](https://geo.lwanzo.site/). Or, you can just copy the json.

## How is the project organized ?

The magic is under the data subfolder. It contains two types of file :

1. The `$.json` contains an array of all the 195 (recognized be the UN) with they country codes and ISO Code.
2. Each of the other files is named after the ISO Code of a country and contains a list of its cities.

## How to use ?

Dude, the Bible says freely give not freely teach. And there's nothing to teach, I think everything is pretty straightforward and how you use this depends on your needs.

## Using the API

You have three endpoints :

1. `/` : well, I'm the biggest fan of 2Pac Shakur.

2. `/countries` : returns an array of all the countries.

3. `/cities/:coid` : where **coid** is the ISO code of each country, returns the cities of that country.

## Can I help ?

Sure ! There's a lot to do : some countries have less cities than others, there's for sure a lot of errors that need to be fixed, ... Just, clone or fork and pull request.
